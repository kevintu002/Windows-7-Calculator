## Why did I make this?

This project is my first attempt at getting familiar with React.

## Why not the Windows 10 Calculator?

I do not like nor utilize the Win10 calculator because you cannot use the arrow keys to navigate and select expressions in its history.

## Languages/Libraries used

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Invalid inputs

Invalid inputs will require you to reset the calculator with Clear (Escape) or Clear Entry (Delete)

## Some other neat stuff

The calculator can take keyboard inputs from your 0-9 keys or your numpad. You can also navigate through the history with your arrow keys. The full list of shortcuts is below.
